# bayesian_optimization
An attempt to apply Bayesian optimization algorithm

To test Bayesian Optimmization on a real machine learning model, define a function which takes hyper-parameters as input 
and output a metric that you need to minimize in model.R 

To launch the Bayesian optimization, please run bayesian_optimization.R
